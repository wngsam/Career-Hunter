A job listing site using Indeed's API with Glassdoor's API.

I wanted to have a site where I can search for listings on Indeed but also have it automatically find company information (if available) from glassdoor. This way I don't have to manually look on Glassdoor and can find basic information like ratings, company site url, etc on the same page.

Further plans were to expand customization of the searchers and implement user accounts with saved job postings. These plans have been put on hold. I have moved onto a different project.
